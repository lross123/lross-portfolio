    <h2>Masters Dissertation</h2>
    <p>This page provides an overview of my masters dissertation. The work
    explores mathematical models for tissue growth using stochastic
    processes, combining theoretical analysis with computational
    simulation. The project showcases my ability to perform advanced
    research, derive and implement complex algorithms, and communicate
    findings to both technical and non‑technical audiences.</p>

    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>Tissue growth is inherently stochastic; individual cell behaviours and
    micro‑environmental factors introduce randomness at multiple scales.
    Understanding how these random interactions lead to emergent
    macroscopic patterns can improve our knowledge of biological
    development and inform therapeutic strategies.</p>

    <h3>Objectives</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Derive stochastic differential equations to model tissue growth and
      cell proliferation under different biological assumptions.</li>
      <li>Develop numerical methods to simulate these processes efficiently
      across spatial domains and parameter regimes.</li>
      <li>Analyse the statistical properties of simulated tissue growth and
      compare them with experimental or published data.</li>
      <li>Explore potential applications of the models in medicine and
      biotechnology.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Key Findings</h3>
    <p>The dissertation demonstrates that stochastic models capture
    heterogeneity and randomness more accurately than deterministic
    approaches. Simulations reveal how small fluctuations can lead to
    significant variations in growth trajectories. Parameter sweeps
    highlight critical thresholds where tissue patterns transition from
    homogeneous to heterogeneous growth.</p>
